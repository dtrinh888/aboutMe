	  <h1>Introduction</h1>
	  <p>I’m a Front End and iOS developer who loves good design, good coffee, and good people. I work as a Front-End Development and iOS mentor for Thinkful, a web developer for IdeaBase, and a freelance iOS developer.</p>
	  <p>I love the web and all the awesome things that come out of it. I’m excited to live and work in a time of huge advances in web technology. It’s easier than ever to share and collaborate with others, all because of the Internet.</p>
	  <p>Education is also super important to me - I come from a family of educators - and I’m stoked to work with Thinkful’s awesome student community.</p></section>

	  <h1> Where I'm From</h1>
	  <p>I’m from the Midwest - Ohio, specifically - Cleveland, even more specifically. I love the spacious fields, the smell of the outdoors, and the people in Ohio. I bring a bit of the Midwest work ethic to all my projects - a craftsman’s approach to Doing Things Right the First Time.</p>
	  <p>I’m finishing my design degree at Kent State University, and will be graduating this winter with a focus in interaction design.</p>

	  <h1>More About Me</h1>
	  <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
	  <p>I’m a huge gamer. I also <strong>LOVE</strong> food. I’m always trying new cuisine. Foodies unite!</p>
	  <h2>What’s your dream job?</h2>
	  <p>I’d love to open my own mobile game studio in the future!</p>
	  <h2>What’s your background?</h2>
	  <p>I’ve been programming since I was in middle school. I decided to go to school for design because I love front-end and felt like I needed more help with the design side than the programming side.</p>
	  <h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
	  <p>I’ve been listening to a ton of <strong><font color="blue">Ryn Weaver</font></strong> lately, ever since her first EP came out in late July.</p>
